## BTU Mod

Very smooth, *very expensive*.

If you want to use BTUs rather than bearings, you will need to print the bottom adapter btu model, and source some 4.8mm BTUs.

The adapter model is designed around those: https://nl.rs-online.com/web/p/ball-transfer-units/7431408/.

Note/Reminder: you will need to source your own 4.8mm BTU

## Printable BTU Mod

Pretty smooth, *less expensive*.

You can use this option if you don't want to use bearings or buy the expensive BTU part. You will need 3 3.175mm (1/8") ball bearings then print the bottom btu model, and 3 of the printable btu models. Press the balls into the model then insert them into the bottom btu model.

## Printable BTU Mod - with screws

Uses screws instead of pression fit to hold the ball inserts in the model. You will need M3 4mm screws.

Two versions : with 3.175mm balls, and 4mm balls.

Print:
- [Bottom BTU Model](printable-btu-screws/bottom.stl)
- [3.175mm insert](printable-btu-screws/balls-3.1mm/inserts.stl)
- [4mm insert](printable-btu-screws/balls-4mm/inserts.stl)


### Upgraded inserts for the Printable BTU Mod

A bit taller of inserts, at 5mm tall, and a little more pronounced recess for the bearing ball.

The snap of the bearing ball is a little less intense as a result and gives more surface angle for the ball to rest on, resulting in a more secure seat for the ball.

Print: 
- [Bottom BTU Model](printable-btu-screws/bottom.stl)
- [tall-inserts.stl](printable-btu-screws/balls-3.1mm/tall-inserts.stl)

Print and snap off supports. Sand the burrs if necessary.
