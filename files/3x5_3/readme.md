# 3x5_3

This is a mod of the Skeletyl v3 to add the trackball mount to the inside of the keyboard. 

The tall version will not interfere with the base plate allowing any Skeletyl v3 base plates and tents to be used.

The low version's trackball will interfere with the base plate requiring a cutout in the plate for it to fit. This also means it will not lay flat and requires tenting.


## Plates
The chairmount plates requires a heat insert for 1/4 inch camera mount threads.
