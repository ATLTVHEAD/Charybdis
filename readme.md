# Charybdis


An ergonomic keyboard with integrated trackball.

Engineered to be a full mouse replacement solution with high-quality, custom-developed components.

There are 4x6, 3x6 "Mini" and 3x5 "Nano" versions.

Made to be used with the [Scylla](https://github.com/Bastardkb/Scylla), [TKB Mini](https://github.com/Bastardkb/TBK-Mini) or [Skeletyl](https://github.com/Bastardkb/Skeletyl) on the other half.

# Sourcing the components


## Print the case

The STL files are included in this Github.
Feel free to use and modify them at length. The files are on a non-commercial license, so this is for personal projects only - please do not use those to sell them.

Please find detailed instructions on how to print the case here:
https://docs.bastardkb.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020031180-Print-settings-for-Dactyls

You will need to print:

- ball adapter, top
- ball adapter, bottom

Please note the adapter of the 3x5 is not compatible with the 4x6, and vice-versa.

On top of that, for each part of the keyboard you decide to print (case, plate, tent) you will need to print the other side from the normal keyboard (eg. left Scylla/right Charybdis 4x6, left Skeletyl / right Charybdis Nano 3x5)

## Printing the tents and plates

If you are printing a Charybdis 4x6, just print the plates and optional tent.

If you are printing a Charybdis Nano 3x5, there are multiple options available - take a look at the `readme` in the `3x5` folder

## Get a kit from BastardKB

You can get a full Kit, including case and all PCBs and electronics required on the shop:
https://bastardkb.com/

If you want to print the case yourself, you can also get just the electronics Kit.


## Electronic components

If you are sourcing the electronic components yourself, you can find a BOM in the [BOM](electronics_bom.md) file.

## Mods

There are some mods to add BTUs or ball bearings, check the *mods* folder.
